console.clear(); //this allows to show one result rather a various results fromn the first value

var fistNum = 10;
console.log(fistNum);

var secondNum= 15;
console.log(secondNum);

//Camel Case (Recommended for JS)
var firstNum;
//Pascal Case
var FirstNum;
//Snake Case
var first_Num;

//Rules for naming JS variables
/* 
-Name can contain letters, digits, _ and $

var mySubject1;
math$;

-Name cannot start with a digit

var _subjectmarks, $rankInClass;

-Names are case Sensitive

var x, X;

-Names cannot be reserve keywords

var var (unspected token; is wrong)
